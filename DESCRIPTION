Description: Functions to plot and help understand positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and their relationship with sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence. See Akobeng, A.K. (2007) <doi:10.1111/j.1651-2227.2006.00180.x> for a theoretical overview of the technical concepts and Navarrete et al. (2015) for a practical explanation about the importance of their understanding <doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01327>.
